## Role Management
List of role commands:
*`!role (role to add to yourself)`/n
*`!removerole (role to remove from youself)`
*`!addrole (role to add to the list of assignable roles)`
*`!deleterole (role to remove from the list of assignable roles)`
*`!listroles`
It's designed so that you can lock this function to a specific channel. This is to avoid clutter. The add and delete role commands are also set so only certain users can use them.
